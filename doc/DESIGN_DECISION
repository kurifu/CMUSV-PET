<b>Key design decisions</b>

Team Rail Blazers made the decision to use xml to store static data.
Disadvantages of using DB:
- Accessing DB is a “cost” from a real life project
- Consumes a bit of memory each access

Solution: put static data in XML files
- We will have accessor methods to pull out the data from XML, then store these values into Dyanmic Tables

Advantages of this Approach:
- Static data does not affect and will not be affected by Dynamic data; completely separate
- We avoid joining 4 tables when looking up an entry in the Deliverables table; the static data will already be there because we already populated them

Static Tables to be Turned into XML Files:
- Lifecycle
- Phase
- Deliverable_Type
- Unit of Measurement

XML Accessor Methods:
- Will need to parse XML file and return one or more values in one or more formats (single value, array, array of specific values, etc)

<b>Database design</b>

Deliverables Tables
Project_id  Deliverable_id  lifecycle   phase   deliverable_type deliverable_name    deliverable_desc deliverable_url complexity  unit_of_measurement estimated_size  production_rate estimated_effort        


Projects Table
project_id  project_name    project_desc    project_status  lifecycle
